## Technical story

### Context and Problem statement
We want to decide on the best way to provide some form of user account management while maintaingin the applications simplicity with regards to scope
and not detracting from its purpose.

### Considered options:
* Pursue creating a user account amangement system complete with authentication and verification to ensure multiple users can securely use the product, thsu making it more distributable
* Abandon the idea of supporting multiple users and dispense with user account management as a concept to focus solely on providing a single user product.


### Desicion outcome:
As a group we decided to go with the latter option after a review of the technologies that would be required to do the first option and our collective lack of experience in any of them when contrasted with the limited timeframe. Another key factor driving the desicion was that user account management(mutiple users) was also deliberated to be outside of the problem that our product attempted to solve so was alos untlimately unnecessary.


#### Positive outcomes
 smaller workload for the team, improving team health and more time to focus on perfecting the rest of the product
 
##### Negative outcomes
Had to compromise on one of the integral features for the teams original conception of the product, so minimal costs of adaptation were present
