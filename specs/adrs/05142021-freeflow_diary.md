## Technical story

### Context and Problem statement
The desicion was about if the product should still contain its free flow diary feature, the main contrasting issues at stake in this desicion were feasibility of making the diary(vis a vis time,resourcesa nd expertise), and how true to the proposed solution our product would end up being.

### Considered options:
* Pursue creating a free flow diary which was dynamic in the types of input it accepted and would likley be organized in a collections format
* Abandon the idea of creating this free flow diary given the constraints associated with it especially lack of time and expetise and the opportunity cost of being unablee to perfect the products other features.


### Desicion outcome:
As a group we decided to go with the latter option after a review of the technologies that would be required to do the first option and our collective lack of experience in any of them when contrasted with the limited timeframe.
#### Positive outcomes
 smaller workload for the team, improving team health and more time to focus on perfecting the rest of the product
 
##### Negative outcomes
Our product wouldn't deliver the holistic solution we initally envisoned it to be able to do.
