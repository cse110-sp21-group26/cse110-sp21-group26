As visible above our team health remains functional as we have good amounts of openness and respect meaning that everyone is still in a comfortable environment. Although we have gotten a bit stressed with regards to the course.


- **Mad, sad and glad:**

While lack of communication did still persist to be a problem, we had made improvements from before, however we still have room for improvement. All of us are collectively upset that we won't be able to finsih the project, however we will do our best. Also we are glad to have each others support and understanding during this time, because the trust helps rally our efforts.



- **Action Plan**

  - Focus entirely on what's possible and get it complete
