# Week 5, Monday Brainstorm Meeting
### Designing Miro and ideas for the Brainstorming Activity
#### Based on our first brainstorm session 4/20/21 we will be focusing on these topics:
##### Karan - Motivtional: 
   - checkboxes (To help with motivation in getting stuff done) 
   - Some sort of color coded / priority entry
   - Diary option 
   - Goal section
   - Calender (We all seem to agree)
##### Josh - Widgets:
   - Sticky Notes / White Board (To track fast notes)
   - Share Notes Ideas (similiar to sharing notes on iphone)
   - Calender 
   - Accounts??? (User log in, data stored, passwords)
   - Light / Dark Mode, Langauge Support, text to speech (Maybe?) More accessibility is good.
##### Yujie - Essentials:
   - Category all features such as having a calender and sticky notes then we can expand those ideas futher
   - User Account Magment
   - Main Webpage Aesthetics/View/Readability
   - Diary Webpage - List of things to do to update such as a daily plan.
   - Checkbox to finish tasks
   - Supporting multiple file types (extensions as well)
##### Calvin:
   - Instead of having a password let's have a link that way we can avoid having to deal with passwords.
