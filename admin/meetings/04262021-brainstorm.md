   - Share Notes Ideas (similiar to sharing notes on iphone)

   - Instead of having a password let's have a link that way we can avoid having to deal with passwords.
   - Encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement statistics section that keeps track of # of items you completed and moved forward and time spent on website.

### Going Forward:
We are a small team so we need to set realistic goals for our pitch.
We do not have as many hands and brains as a larger team would have so what can we do to succeed and what kind of app should we have in mind?
Given Deepak knows more about JS than we do, what should we do, what is a good starting point for building our structure?
