## Alejandro's Ideas:
    1. Possibly? (Definitely more of an extra time feature) Implementing a very light version of a daily horoscope
          - Maybe a daily bible verse?
          - Something additional that will attract the user to use this bullet journal daily
    2. Support for adding progress pictures (weight loss, body lifting)
          - Gives the user affirmations, motivation to keep going?
    3. Organization for different topics, so having the ability to create folders
          - This could be used for seperating different categories of notes, for example, a folder for music ideas, a folder for daily tasks/school or work
    4. Possibly? Have an option for a reminder via email for certain tasks.
