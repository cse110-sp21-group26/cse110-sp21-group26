  "Checkboxes in a to-do list so user gets a sense of accomplishment upon finishing a task"
  
  "An option that allows certain tasks to be listed as priority/important, maybe in a different color or bolded, will show up at the top of a given day's entry"
  
  "A diary option which allows users to just write their thoughts about a certain day"
  
  "A section that has things the user is looking forward to if they ever need encouragement to finish their tasks"
  
  "A goals section that can have short-term or long-term goals so the user knows what they are working towards"
  
  "A calendar option which allows the user to get a gauge of how much time exists till a given task has to be completed"
