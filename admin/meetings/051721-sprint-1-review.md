# Week 8, Monday Start of the Review for Sprint 1 Meeting

### Talking Assignments
    After speaking with the team we have decided that most of us will continue working on the same projects as last week (to finish up before merging our components together)
    Our main goal is to get a minimal, yet functioning BUJO template pushed out by the end of next week.
    
### Team Status 
    Below will be our tentative schedule updates:
    1. Calendar Weekly/Monthly/Daily View (Alex and Joshua)
    2. Task List (To Dos), marked as priority/important (Yujie and Anoop)
    4. Sticky Notes (Calvin and TBD)
    5. Mood Tracker (Margarita and Joshua )
    6. Skeleton Design (Karan and TBD)
    
### Big Decisions
Our Coding Convention we will include the following:
1. We agreed and will continue to use camelCase for our functions and variable names.
2. Any CSS colors will be in HEX format
3. For now, our current font of choice will be sans-serif
4. Currently, we have been testing our code using Cypress and getting Github Actions working
5. Our jsdoc will be in the standard format of:
```Javascript
/**
 * Represents a book.
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} title - The title of the book.
 * @param {string} author - The author of the book.
 */
 ```

### Updates
Today we created our ADI pipeline as well as started to unit test our software, We used cypress to unit test as well as work with GitHub Actions

Additionally, we spoke about what type of coding conventions we will be using for our code. Since our bootstrap template utilizes camel case programming we will incorporate the same conventions into our code. Additionally, we will try to stay to HEX format for our CSS colors.
With a few pull request and implementation quirks we started to think about our walking skeleton video.

## Our walking skeleton video will include the following:
 - A walkthrough through the software we used to unit test our software
 - We will show off the working skeleton code we have as well as some working components
 - We will also discuss the team health
 - Additionally, we will plan to meet by the end of this week to finalize our next video before next Monday.
 - A few things we need to get working are the following : The calendar, the task list, and integrating them all into one page.
 - By unit testing we hope to achieve a functional user testing software template by the end of the next spring.
 - After 

### Acomplished Today:
By midnight tonight ( Monday, May 17th)
We will be pushing out our first checkpoint (Checkpoint 1) for our CPI-pipeline. (Our pipeline will cover all the things we have done so far, such as setting up local code, unit testing, deploying it, and what to do if one of the fail or succeed)
We will also be finishing our first video assignment
Two videos for our CI/CD Pipeline and another ADR pushed out.
We made a CI/CD Flow Diagram to go over everything we have accomplished thus far such as:
    - Programming on our local machines
    - Making sure our code compiles
    - Unit Testing
    - Pushing onto Github
