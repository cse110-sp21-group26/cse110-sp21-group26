# Week 10, Tuesday June 1st; Sprint 2 Meeting

### Talking Assignments
    After speaking with the team we have decided that most of us will continue working on the same projects as last week 
    (to finish up before merging our components together)
    Our main goal is to get a minimal, yet functioning BUJO template pushed out by the end of next week.
    
### Team Status 
    Below is our new updates:
    1. Calvin: Sticky Note implementation going well, added into skeleton and added boundaries
    2. Yujie: Task lisk is working great with local storage, working on priority and scaling down
    3. Anoop: Calender is working just working on drag && drop feature for events/tasks
    4. Margarita & Josh : Mood Tracker working almost, need to work on local storage to create graph
    5. Karan: Skeleton is looking good, need to implement the daily quote
    
### Big Decisions
     We agreed to use window.localStorage to handle all our storage for the following:
     1. Sticky Notes
     2. Tasks List
     3. Events
     4. Mood Tracker


### Updates
Today we created our last adr which will cover how we will be implementing our local storage.

Additionally we have gotten unit testing set up, as well as pull request. The team has been confident on their indivdual components and we will begin integration soon.
