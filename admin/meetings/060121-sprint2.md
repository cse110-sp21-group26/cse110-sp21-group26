# Week 10, Tuesday June 1st; Sprint 2 Meeting

### Talking Assignments
    After speaking with the team we have decided that most of us will continue working on the same projects as last week 
    (to finish up before merging our components together)
    Our main goal is to get a minimal, yet functioning BUJO template pushed out by the end of next week.
    
### Team Status 
    Below is our new updates:
    1. Calvin:
    2. Yujie
    3. Anoop
    4. Margarita & Josh
    5. Karan
    
### Big Decisions
     We agreed to use window.localStorage to handle all our storage for the following:
     1. Sticky Notes
     2. Tasks List
     3. Events
     4. Mood Tracker


### Updates
Today we created our last adr which will cover how we will be implementing our local storage.

Additionally we have gotten unit testing set up, as well as pull request. The team has been confident on their indivdual components and we will begin integration soon.
