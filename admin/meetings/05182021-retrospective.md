  As seen above our collective health is satisfactory, we can attribiute most of our apprehensive/bad reactions to the challenges that came with       organizing and running our first sprint. We were able to discuss what each of us individually was upset about and how best to shape our dev       enviroment so it ould ocntribute less to unhappiness and become more of an encouraging atmoshpere.


- **Mad, glad and sad**

    This exercise in retrium allowed us to express what our team members didn't like so far abot how the agile process was being conducted. what   they liked and other things that might be distressing them(extranous to the project). The main issues that people seemed to be upset about were   focused on the inconsistencies in communication and how these lead to often late discussions for assignments. Another key problem that people noted was the difficulty in reaching all team members succesflly all the time. These problems would then go on to be addressed in our action plan. What   the team was also sad about included how disconnected we seemed when working on individual features and the complexity of the lab assignments.
  On the flip side everyone was greatful for everyone else on the team.
