As seen above our collective health is satisfactory, we can attribiute most of our apprehensive/bad reactions to the challenges that came with organizing and running our first sprint. We were able to discuss what each of us individually was upset about and how best to shape our de enviroment so it ould ocntribute less to unhappiness and become more of an encouraging atmoshpere.
